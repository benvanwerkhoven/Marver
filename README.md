Marver
======

Marver is a tool for static code analysis, transformation, and
user-guided source-to-source translation. The goal of Marver is to
increase the productivity of experienced GPU programmers when porting
large long-lived applications to GPUs.

In contrast to many existing GPU programming tools, Marver does not aim
to hide the complexities of GPU Programming. Instead, Marver aims to do
the all routine translation work that would otherwise require a huge
manual porting efforts.

Marver can perform user-guided source-to-source translation to generate
GPU code that - for the moment - needs to be finished by hand by the GPU
programmer. The benefit of this approach is that GPU programmers remain
in control over important design decisions on the GPU code.
